# CO₂ Mineralization Calculator

A web-based calculator for determining CO₂ injection requirements for concrete carbonation processes. This tool helps calculate the optimal CO₂ dosage for both lab-scale testing and industrial-scale production.

## Features

- **Lab Scale Calculator**: Calculate CO₂ requirements for test blocks
- **Industrial Scale Calculator**: Calculate annual CO₂ requirements for production
- **Dosage Optimization**: Get recommendations based on scientifically validated ranges
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant results as you adjust parameters
- **Safety Alerts**: Warnings for dosage ranges that may affect concrete strength

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` (or `co2_calculator (1).html`) in a web browser
2. Select Lab Scale or Industrial Scale tab
3. Enter your project parameters
4. Adjust CO₂ dosage using the quick-select buttons or manual input
5. View calculated results and recommendations

## Optimal Dosage Ranges

- **0.2-0.4%**: Optimal range with expected strength increase
- **0.5%**: Upper boundary - use with caution
- **>0.5%**: High risk - may cause strength reduction

## Technologies

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No dependencies or build process required
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
